# Project 1 - Part 1: Build a VPC
**Description:**  
A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network. It allows you to define your own IP address range, create subnets, configure route tables, and set up network gateways. A VPC provides control over your network environment, including security settings and connectivity options.
